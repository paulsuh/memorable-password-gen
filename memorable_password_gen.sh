# 
# A short shell script that will print out any desired number of random
# passwords of the form <word1><digit><punctuation><word2>. 
#
# The second argument will ensure that the password is at least
# that many characters long. Default minimum length is 15. 
#
# usage: ./password_gen.sh [num passwords] [min length]
#
# This example will print out 5 random passwords, each of which is at
# least 12 characters long. 
#
# ./password_gen 5 12
#
# The words used come from the Moby list downloaded from here:
#   https://ai1.ai.uga.edu/ftplib/natural-language/moby/moby.tar.Z
#
# The passwords are based on open compound nouns (two-word compound nouns), 
# filtered so that each element contains at least four letters and 
# does not contain any capital letters (removes proper nouns). 
#
# The punctuation is from the list -/:;()$&@".,?!' which are the 
# punctuation characters that can be typed on an iOS keyboard with only
# shifting to numerics.
